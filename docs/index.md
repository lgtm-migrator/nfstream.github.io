# Getting Started
{: .no_toc }

**NFStream** is a Python framework providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make 
working with **online** or **offline** network data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level 
building block for doing practical, **real world** network data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader 
goal of becoming **a common network data analytics framework for researchers** providing data reproducibility 
across experiments.

## Main Features

* **Performance:** NFStream is designed to be fast: AF_PACKETV3/FANOUT on Linux, parallel processing, native C 
(using [**CFFI**][cffi]) for critical computation and [**PyPy**][pypy] support.
* **Encrypted layer-7 visibility:** NFStream deep packet inspection is based on [**nDPI**][ndpi]. 
It allows NFStream to perform [**reliable**][reliable] encrypted applications identification and metadata 
fingerprinting (e.g. TLS, SSH, DHCP, HTTP).
* **Statistical features extraction:** NFStream provides state of the art of flow-based statistical feature extraction. 
It includes both post-mortem statistical features (e.g. min, mean, stddev and max of packet size and inter arrival time) 
and early flow features (e.g. sequence of first n packets sizes, inter arrival times and
directions).
* **Flexibility:** NFStream is easily extensible using [**NFPlugins**][nfplugin]. It allows to create a new 
feature within a few lines of Python.
* **Machine Learning oriented:** NFStream aims to make Machine Learning Approaches for network traffic management 
reproducible and deployable. By using NFStream as a common framework, researchers ensure that models are trained using 
the same feature computation logic and thus, a fair comparison is possible. Moreover, trained models can be deployed 
and evaluated on live network using [**NFPlugins**][nfplugin].
